I worked on the source code with visual studio code, and installed an extension which allows me to work on files in Ubuntu. 

The compiler I install on Ubuntu is g++, I use this to compile my C++ code on Ubuntu in this case.

After compiling, the way to execute is to type the command:
“./test InputPLAname outputDOTname”.
test: The file created after compiling.
InputPLAname: Target PLA file in the current directory.
outputDOTname: Target DOT file in the current directory.
