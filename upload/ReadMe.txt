The programming language I choose to use for this programming assignment is Python.
The way to execute it is to type the following command in Ubuntu:
python3 B11032020.py input.kiss output.kiss output.dot 

python3: to specify that we are going to use python version 3.
B11032020.py: Our main python file name.
input.kiss: You can put any file name you prefer.
output.kiss: You can name the output file whatever you like.
output.dot: Name of the output dot file, specific any name.
